Common Green Darner,Odonata,Anisoptera,Aeshnoidea,Aeshnidae,Anax,junius,"This widespread species is one of the most commonly seen in the region. The face is pale green with a distinct black spot on the top of the frons bordered anteriorly by a blue semicircle congering the impression of a bulls eyes. The thorax is green with brown only lightly represented on the lateral sutures. The wings are clear with a yellow costa. The abdomen is mostly blue, with green on segment 1 in males and greenish-brown or reddish-brown throughout in females. The brown superior caudal appendages in the male are long, about the length of segments 9-10 combined.",Total length: 68-84 mm; abdomen: 46-60 mm; hindwing: 45-58 mm.,68-84 mm,46-60 mm,45-58 mm.,Amazon Darner (A. amazili) has a triangular spot on the top of the frons and the abdomen appears ringed. Giant Darner (A. walsinghami) is much larger and Great Pondhawk (Erythemis vesiculosa) is much smaller.,"Permanent and temporary ponds, lakes, bays and slow-flowing streams with emergent vegetation.","This species is probably one of the most familiar dragonflies in all of North America. It is one of the few North American dragonflies that migrates and is therefore most common in the spring and fall. It is a voracious predator commonly taking wasps, butterflies, mosquitoes, and other dragonflies on the wing (photo 000). It has even been reported to attack hummingbirds and can be cannibalistic. It is not uncommon to walk through an open field of tall grass in the early morning and have Common Green Darners flying up from their perches low to the ground, an unusual behavior amongst darners. Mating pairs may fall out of the air to the ground or be seen hanging in bushes or trees. This species is unusual among the darners within the region because females will lay eggs in tandem. Individuals darken considerably in response to cold temperatures but regain their original color upon warming up. There is evidence that its migratory movements are strongly dictated by seasonal warm fronts.",Found throughout North America including all 50 United States; also West Indies; Guatemala and Belize south to Costa Rica and recently England.
Comet Darner,Odonata,Anisoptera,Aeshnoidea,Aeshnidae,Anax,longipes,"This distinct darner has the typical green thorax of the genus, but the abdomen is brick red. The face is yellow-green, but unlike other green darners the top of the frons is unmarked. The legs are unusually long and the femora are red except distally where they become black. The costa is green. The male abdomen is bright red beyond the basal green segments. Females are similar, but with greenish-brown spots, and with blue i
n young individuals on the middle and posterior segments.",Total length: 75-87 mm; abdomen: 50-61 mm; hindwing: 46-56 mm.,75-87 mm,50-61 mm,46-56 mm.,"The brick red abdomen contrasted with the green thorax of older individuals is a combination not seen in any other species with in the south-central United States. Amazon Darner (A. amazili
) and female Common Green Darners (A. junius
) both have markings on the frons.",Primarily fishless temporary and semi-permanent grassy ponds and pools.,"This is an uncommon species, widely distributed throughout the eastern parts of the region. Its interactions with Common Green Darner are unclear. Comet Darner has been reported both outnumbering and being out competed by Common Green Darner in semipermanent artificial ponds. Individuals are not active as late in the day as Common Green Darners. Females lay eggs in submerged vegetation.","Throughout eastern U.S., Ontario and Quebec; southward to Texas and Florida."
Great Spreadwing,Odonata,Zygoptera,Lestoidea,Lestidae,Archilestes,grandis,"Great Spreadwing is found commonly in the Texan biotic province westward. It is the largest damselfly in the United States and can be readily identified in the field based on its large
 size, spreadwing perching behavior and distinct bright yellow thoracic stripes. The mesepisternum is a complete dark, metallic green stripe no more than half the sclerite width. This stripe is generally not contiguous with the middorsal carina; though it is occasionally narrowed towards the middle. The mesepimeron is variable with a metallic green or black stripe. This stripe may extend the full-length or slightly more than 1/2 the width of the sclerite. The remainder of the pterothorax is yellow, resulting in two broad, pale stripes. The wings are either clear or smoky, becoming darker at tips. The first 1/3 to 1/2 of the abdomen is dark metallic green dorsally, becoming yellow or tan ventrolaterally. This pattern becomes obscured with age. There is a narrow, dark, middorsal stripe and black apical ventrolateral carinae on segment 9. Segment 10 has a proximally directed dark median triangle on its dorsum. Mature males develop a white pruinosity laterally and basally on segments 1 and
 2, all of segments 9 and 10, and on the sterna of segments 7 and 8. Females are more robust than males. The general coloration is similar, but with the head paler. The dark mesepisternum and mesepimeron stripes are often narrower and sometimes nearly lacking. The proximal abdominal segments are pale bluish. Segment 10 is tan to nearly black. The basal plate of the ovipositor is truncated posterolaterally. Margins of the valves are strongly and coarsely toothed.",Total length: 50-62 mm; abdomen: 38-47; hindwing: 31-39 mm.,50-62 mm,38-47,31-39 mm.,"Pond spreadwings (Lestes
) are smaller with the length of the hindwing less than 30 mm. No other damselfly in our region approaches the size of Great Spreadwing.",Small permanent ponds or streams with slow or moderate flow,"This species was known only from the southwest United States up until the 1920's, but it has since undergone a dramatic range expansion northward. It now occurs as far northeast as western New England. One study showed that that neither males nor females exhibited any type of courtship behavior, and unreceptive females showed no refusal signs, but rather were simply not at the water or escaped by rapid flight when unreceptive. No pairs were observed ovipositing from beginning to end, but the longest observed egg-laying time was 109 min.",South Carolina north to Vermont west to California and south through Central America to Colombia and Venezuela
Blue-fronted Dancer,Odonata,Zygoptera,Coenagrionoidea,Coenagrionidae,Argia,apicalis,"The head of the male is pale blue anterior to the ocelli and black behind the ocelli with a stripe extending forward to the base of each antennae. The pale blue occipital spots are sometimes connected. The lower lateral third and ventral parts of the pterothorax are pale yellow becoming pruinose and obscured with age. The black thoracic markings however are never obscured. The middorsal carina is narrowly outlined with black. The humeral suture is a hairline black stripe widening above and below, but more so anteriorly. The legs are pale, darkly marked with black on the outer surfaces of the femora and the inner surfaces of the tibiae and tarsi. The abdominal color pattern is black dorsally on segments 1-7, except for pale blue basal rings on segments 3-7. Segments 8-10 are uniformly pale blue over their entire length. The ventrolateral areas of these segments are black. The cerci are short and blunt when viewed laterally, but when viewed posteriorly two
decurved hooks are visible. The paraprocts extend out beyond the cerci, but both are shorter than or subequal in length to segment 10. The paraprocts are distinctly bifid. The head of the female is similarly colored to the male. The dark humeral stripe is usually thin, as in the male, but occasionally it may extend to the mesepimeron. The mesostigmal plates lack posterior lobes, but when viewed laterally the anterior carina is usually visible. Mesepisternal tubercles are small or lacking. The legs are similarly colored to the males. The abdominal color pattern is similar to the male, but often with more extensive black markings. Segments 8-10 are black dorsally, each with a dark dorsolateral stripe.",Total length: 33-40 mm; abdomen: 26-32 mm; hindwing: 21-25 mm.,33-40 mm,26-32 mm,21-25 mm.,"Blue-tipped Dancer (A. tibialis
) has abdominal segment 8 black. Female Powdered Dancers (A. moesta
) look very similar, but are larger. All other dancers will have a broader middorsal thoracic stripe.","Large rivers and occasionally streams, lakes or ponds.","A study of a population of this species, residing at a small pasture pond in Marshall County, Oklahoma, found that males and females reached reproductive age at an average of 8.4 and 7.0 days, respectively with maximum activity occurring at noon. Males were at the water 44% of the days they lived and females only 20%; however, males only mated on 20% of these days and females 89%. Repeat matings, in both sexes, were rare. The movement from roosting sites to the water was characterized by a random shifting, with males arriving at the water earlier than females and spacing themselves at six-foot intervals. Mating occurred a short distance from the main concentration of males and lasted 16 minutes. Females were gregarious laying eggs, either in tandem (75% of the
 time
) or alone, in willow roots, boards and sticks. Further study revealed that males occurred in two color phases: bright blue and a gray-black, and that color change could not be correlated positively with age or reproduction. In the same study, females occurred in three color phases: brown, turquoise and gray-black. Further observations in the field have revealed that the gray-black phase is a temporary color change that occurs during mating and at cool temperatures. Males live more than a month and exhibit intra- and interspecific competition, flicking their wings as a warning to intruders in their territory. On hot days they thermoregulate by raising their abdomen to a 60B0 angle, reducing the surface area exposed to the sun. Variable thoracic stripe patterns are seen in individuals along the periphery of the species' southeastern distribution, with both a broad-striped form, having a wide full-length humeral stripe, and the more typical form with a reduced pattern, as seen in the s
outh-central United States.","Generally east of the Rocky Mountains from Florida to Ontario, but also known from eastern Arizona."
Kiowa Dancer,Odonata,Zygoptera,Coenagrionoidea,Coenagrionidae,Argia,immunda,"The male's head is largely pale violet. There is a distinct but irregular black bar between the eyes and the large violet postocular spots. The antehumeral stripe is pale blue or violet and about the same width as the black middorsal stripe. The black humeral stripe is forked at its upper half and the metapleural suture is outlined in black line. The bottom of the pterothorax generally has a mottled appearance. The femora are pale w
ith dark stripes running lengthwise. The inner sides of the tibiae are pale and the tarsi are black. There are generally only 3 postquadrangular cells in both the fore- and hindwing. The abdomen is pale violet or sometimes blue with black maculation. There is a basal black spot and small antero- and posterolateral spot on segment 1. Segment 2 has 3 spots, an apical and basal superior spot and an inferior middle spot; all of which may be confluent. Segments 3-6 are marked with black post-basally and on the apical 1/3 of each segment laterally. On segments 4-6 these post-basal streaks are generally confluent with the opposite side resulting in a distinct pale, dark, pale, dark pattern of the abdomen. Segment 7 is entirely black with a thin pale basal ring. Segments 8-10 are blue with a ventrolateral black streak. The cerci are divided at their tip and the cerci are sharply bifurcate with the lower lobe rounded and the superior lobe acutely directed dorso-posteriorly. The female is simila
rly colored to the male but paler. The forked humeral stripe is thin and scarcely covers the suture. The antehumeral stripe is pale and often marked with darker spots. The mesostigmal plates lack a posterior lobe and their posterior margin is generally elevated medially. The middorsal thoracic carina bifurcates widely, well behind the posterior margin and the mesepisternal tubercles are lacking. The abdomen is marked as in the male, but with segment 7 not as black and similar to segment 6. Segments 8 and 9 are pale with a dark ventrolateral stripe on each side. Segment 10 is entirely pale.",Total length: 33-38 mm; abdomen: 25-31 mm; hindwing: 19-25 mm.,33-38 mm,25-31 mm,19-25 mm.,"Variable (A. fumipennis

) are similar but lack the pale-dark-pale-dark abdominal pattern unique to Kiowa Dancer. Its size and this distinctive pattern should separate this species from all other damselflies in the region.",Streams and rivers.,"Despite the fact that this species is widely distributed in our region and commonly encountered, remarkably little is known of its biology. Though the alternating pale, dark, pale, dark pattern on the abdomen is always visible, it can become slightly obscured with age.",Southwestern U.S. from California eastward to South Dakota and Texas; also south through Mexico to Belize.
Powdered Dancer,Odonata,Zygoptera,Coenagrionoidea,Coenagrionidae,Argia,moesta,"The head of young males is dark brown, with a pale labium, labrum, clypeus, genae and frons. Older individuals have a blue-white pruinosity dorsally on the head. There is a dark brown middorsal stripe and a pale antehumeral stripe approximately half its width. A dark narrow humeral stripe extends nearly to the antealar carina and is confluent with the mesepimeral stripe anteriorly. The legs are pale with dark stripes on the outer surfaces of the femora and the tarsi are black. The pterothorax, coxae and femora are all pruinose in older individuals. There are 4 and 5 postquadrangular cells in the fore- and hindwings, respectively. The abdomen is brown basally and distally on segments 9 and 10. The middle segments are much darker, almost black an

The cerci, when viewed laterally are blunt and rounded with a dorsally-directed tooth near apex. Females are similarly patterned to males and can be tan or blue. The narrow middorsal carina is outlined in black and a dark humeral stripe is barely visible. The metapleural suture is unmarked or often with a thin dark line and a brown spot in close proximity to the antealar carina. The mesostigmal plates have a distinct posterior lobe bearing a low ridge that curves over the middle half of each plate, when viewed dorsally. Mesepisternal tubercles are present. The legs are pale, but with dark stripes on the outer surfaces of the femora and the inner surfaces of the tibiae. The tarsi and accompanying spurs are dark. The abdomen is pale blue or brown basally becoming darker posteriorly and a pale stripe runs its full-length middor
sally, but is constricted apically at each segment. There is a wide dark brown longitudinal stripe paralleling the middorsal stripe except for pale basal rings. Ventrolaterally, a brown spot is visible at the apex of segments 2-7.

) is a larger and darker species with a dark stripe on each side of the middorsal thoracic stripe. Older males are also nearly black, lacking the white pruinescence seen in Powdered Dancer. The top of the middle abdominal segments in Tonto Dancer (A. tonto
) are blue or violet. Female Blue-fronted Dancers (A. apicalis
) are very simialar, but smaller and the last few abdominal segments are generally darker.",Swift currents of rivers and lakes with emergent stones and rocky shores.,"Females in the southeastern United States may have more extensive black markings on the thorax and abdomen, such that they appear more similar to males. They have a wide middorsal stripe that is sometimes divided on each side by a thin pale stripe. The humeral stripe may also be wide and forked medially. A study of individuals in an Ohio stream revealed that individuals will move as much as 185 m away from the stream. Females spend the majority of their time 75-150 m from the water. Males become pruinose starting middorsally on the thorax and become sexually mature when this pruinescence reaches beyond the black midfrontal stripe and females aren't receptive to males until they become blue. This color change requires two days after maturation. Next to
Dusky Dancer (A. translata), Powdered Dancer is probably the most widely distributed species in the genus, occurring from about 45o0 N latitude in Canada to about 20o0 N in Mexico. Powdered Dancer is adaptable when invading new areas, by laying eggs in the previously unutilized surface of Salix roots. Mating and egg laying average 22 and 47 minutes, respectively and females turn dark while in tandem. Tandem pairs will aggregate in large numbers to lay eggs in roots, stems, debris and algae, often submerging themselves more than a meter for periods up to an hour. Two additional studies have shown the first symphoretic association of Powdered Dancer with a non-biting midge (Nanocladius branchicolus
) and the effect of individuals losing their caudal lamellae swimming speed. If two of these lamellae are missing, larger individuals swim faster than smaller ones, but statistically slower than individuals that retain two or three lamellae.","Throughout southern Canada and the United States, except for the Pacific Northwest. Also south into Mexico."

Nymphs are local in occurrence and restricted to slow creeks and quiet areas of running streams. The primary factors affecting their distribution within streams are rate of flow, depth of water and type of vegetation present while, adults occur along a wide variety of stream-riverine conditions and often disperse well away from water. Males will vigorously compete among themselves for territories with submergent vegetation, the prime egg-laying habitat for females. Males attract females with a ""cross display,"" where the male faces the female with his hindwings deflected downward at right angles to his body, and the forewings and abdomen are raised, revealing the ventral pale area of the abdomen. The major
ity of mating and egg laying occurs in the early afternoon and a single male may guard multiple females, resulting in sometimes large congregations. Females will lay their eggs in submergent vegetation for 10 to 120 minutes and usually don't submerge themselves. The displays and behaviors of northern and southern populations may differ. For a summary of these behaviors the reader is directed to Dunkle (1990).

Segment 1 is almost entirely black dorsally with pale apical rings. There is a broad full-length black stripe dorsally on segment 2. Segments 3-6 each have a hastate black stripe running their entire length, or nearly so. Segment 7 is generally all black dorsally with only a pale apical and sometimes basal ring. A full-length black stripe runs from segments 8-10 dorsally. This stripe is occasionally constricted basally on segment 8 and apically on segments 9-10.",Total length: 29-39 mm; abdomen: 22-34 mm; hindwing: 16-21 mm.,29-39 mm,22-34 mm,16-21 mm.,"Segment 7 in male Azure (E. aspersum
) and Northern (E. cyathigerum
) Bluets is all, or nealy so, black. Atlantic Bluet (E. doubledayi
) is very similar and careful examination of the male caudal appendages and female mesostigmal plates will be required for accurate identification. Male Familiar Bluets are one of two species in our region with a distal tubercle on the cerci. The other, Tule Bluet (E. carunculatum
) has a tubercle that protrudes beyond the end of the cerci. This is our most widely distributed bluet, but it is often found flying with other species, so look carefully at populations of little blue damselflies.","Ephemeral or permanent ponds and lakes. Also slow flowing streams, irregardless of salinity and vegetation.","This widely distributed southern species has extended its range dramatically, to now extend from as far south as Colombia and Venezuela and north into southern Canada. It is only absent from the Pacific Northwest in the United States. It has entered California only in the last 80 years and more recently western Montana, British Columbia, Oregon, New York and southern Ontario. It was accidentally introduced into Oahu in 1936 and now occurs commonly on all of the major Hawaiian Islands. Its success is probably due in part to its ability to colonize temporary and newly created aquatic habitats. Prey of
 this species includes adult sweet potato whiteflies and other small flies and insects. One study included notes about a population observed at Sandpit Lake in Dallas Co., Texas, where ""...hundreds were in copula, ovipositing on small plants just below the surface of the water."" Another study looked at oviposition site selection of Familiar Bluet and found that although aggregations reduced the risk of interference and may even lower predation risk, oviposition efficiency was also reduced. The peak activity is from midmorning into the afternoon. Males spend more days at the water (62%
) than females (39%), but males mate on fewer of these days (14%
) than females (79%
) (Bick and Bick 1963). There is no courtship involved in mating which may last as long as 45 minutes, but usually is over in 20 minutes. Egg laying occurs in tandem, with the male letting go to guard at a nearby perch before becoming completely submerged. Eggs are deposited in algae, roots, leaves and upright stems at the surface of the water. Females usually remain submerged an average of 12 minutes, but lay eggs for more than an hour below the surface, descending backwards. Studied polymorphic head color patterns and found that the majority (73-86%
) of mature adult males lacked a postoccipital bar, while in the majority of females it was present. These females were split in having this postoccipital bar confluent (41-42%
) and non-confluent (50-52%
) with the postoccipital spots. One author found Familiar Bluet males hiding underwater in a laboratory aquarium after the room temperature was accidentally left at cool temperatures overnight. This was apparently an attempt to escape the cold temperature and may suggest how damselflies escape cold weather in nature.",Throughout the U.S. and southern Canada except for Pacific Northwest south through Mexico to Colombia and Venezuela.

Other similar skimmers can be distinguished by the face color and or markings in the wings.","Ponds, lakes, ditches, and slow moving creeks, streams and rivers.","This species is known from every county and parish in Arkansas and Louisiana. Its green color and common habit of resting on the ground, trash, logs or other objects, may result in its initial confusion with clubtails, but the eyes are widely joined on top of the head. This species regularly preys on a variety of small and large insects, up to and including other Eastern Pondhawks. Although Eastern Pondhawk inhabits almost any slow moving body of water, they are often found around plants on the water surface, such as water lilies, lotus and duckweed, where males patrol their territories. Males of this species display a unique ""leap frogging"" behavior when defending territories. A male cha
sing another male will suddenly move under the male in front. This swapping of positions will often occur repeatedly. The change in males, from a green coloration to the pruinose blue over the entire thorax and first 7 abdominal segments occurs through a predictable progression of color patterns. Over a period of 2-3 weeks, this species undergoes 17 different color patterns. The rate of color change significantly decreases with both decreasing food consumption and air temperature. Two studies found that sperm from the most recent mating competes for fertilizations with sperm stored from previous matings only if the female oviposits on the following day without re-mating. Sperm mixing in the bursa of females took 24 to 48 hours, at which time the last male to mate had replaced an average of more than 57-75% of the sperm stored by females from previous matings.","Throughout all of central and eastern U.S. and Canada, east of the Rockies."

Female Smoky Rubyspots lack red in the basal area of the hindwing and the abdomen is brownish-green, not distinctly green and tan.","Wide, open streams and rivers.","Males and females will perch horizontally on twigs and leaves of riparian vegetation, although females often perch higher. Sexes may also congregate near the water at night to roost. Numerous aspects of this species' distribution, behavior and ecology have been well studied. Although this is primarily a stream species, it has been shown experimentally that larvae and teneral adults exposed to still water returned to still water habitats after they had matured. There is extensive variability in this species. There are populations that lack a pterostigma, but these seem to be most abundant west of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California and all individuals seen b
y the author in our region have had pterostigmas. Apterostigmatous individuals have been collected as far east as Grant and Lincoln counties, in southwestern New Mexico. An increase in the length of the basal red markings in the wings of males throughout the season has been recorded in three different Texas populations. Basal red markings of males collected in April range from 20-35% of the length of the wing. Males sampled at the same localities in September, however, had substantially larger red markings, ranging from 35-50% of the wing length.","Throughout North America; south through Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras."

The abdomen is uniformly dark brown with green reflections, not distinctly irridescent green dorsally and tan laterally as in American Rubyspot.",Small to medium-sized streams and rivers with strong current.,"The variability of this species has lead to confusion and the recognition of several races and forms. Johnson (1963
) studied sympatric populations of American and Smoky Rubyspots on the Guadalupe River in Gruen and Comfort, Texas, and at the Llano River in Junction, Texas. A third population of Smoky Rubyspot was observed at Chinquapin Creek east of Lufkin, Texas. After observing differences in breeding and territorial behavior, Johnson found that the female body color patterns were consistent and that the females bred with their specific male type. He considered these forms to be possible valid species. He also found the flight seasons of the two forms to be different. Florida collections (FSCA
) revealed occasional intergrades between the two female color patterns of the thorax and showed no apparent difference in flight season leading Johnson and Westfall (1970) to place these forms in a species complex. I follow Garrison (1990) who considers them forms of one species, based on the lack of detectable morphological differences between sexes of either form. The differences in degree of wing color in this species may be correlated with seasonality. Spring populations tend to have the dark markings in their wings restricted to the basal 1/4 of the wing, while mid-summer pouplations show a considerasble increase in the degree of brown in the wings and fall generations have completely dark wings. Like American Rubyspot, both sexes of Smoky Rubyspot perch horizontally on vegetation along the shore. They tend to prefer perches higher up and are more wary than the former. Females will invite mating by hovering and reject males with a display similar to that seen in Ebony Jewelwing (Calopteryx maculata), involving a simultaneous spreading of the wings and bending of the abdomen upward. Guarded above by males, females will spend up to two hours ovipositing underwater in wet wood.",Southeastern United States north to Maryland; west to Wisconsin and Texas and New Mexico; extending southward through Mexico to Costa Rica.
Citrine Forktail,Odonata,Zygoptera,Coenagrionoidea,Coenagrionidae,Ischnura,hastata,"Males of this species are distinct because of a unique pterostigma, that is detached from the costa in the forewing.

In Lilypad Forktail, however, the dorsum of abdominal segment 2 is largely blue and the pale postocular spots are much larger than in Skimming Bluet. No other forktails in our region have the large postocular spots seen in this species.",Strongly associated with floating lily pads in lakes.,"This species is unique, among Nearctic odonates, in its obligatory relationship with water lilies (Nuphar and Nymphaea
) in both the larval and adult stages. Williamson (1899a
) was the first to report this little studied relationship. He stated that he, ""...never saw one at rest on any other location than a flat-floating leaf of the white water-lily. They were quarrelsome neighbors and frequently attacked [Skimming and Orange (E. signatum
) Bluet], though apparently without serious injury."" Larvae cling to the bottom of the lily pads and emerge by crawling on top. The adults are nearly always encountered perching or ovipositing on these plants. They somtimes will exhibit a unique posture; while perching on a pad with the abdomen curled downward, they will tilt back on the abdomen with the front legs in the air ready for an immediate getaway. Females, unaccompanied by males, take up to 20 minutes to deposit eggs. One study on the color morphs in a north-central Texas population of this species found no evidence for dichromatic females, but rather that the color change was ontogenetic. Young teneral females are orange, but with the onset of reproductive maturity become blue. The authors of the study found females of netted copulating pairs were nearly always of an intermediate color form. The young orange color form, however, may be reproductively mature, as indicated by a photograph of a copulating pair in Westfall and
May (1996). Interestingly, the same study found that although Lilypad Forktail is rarely harassed, females do not utilize an active mating refusal display to thwart off nearby males, potentially explaining the photograph.",Eastern U.S. from Florida to Maine west to Michigan and south to Texas.

The Northern Spreadwing (L. disjunctus
) generally does not extend south of north-central New Mexico, but it can be separated from the Southern Spreadwing by its darker color pattern, smaller size (33-40 mm
) and the more strongly developed distal tooth on the cerci. Females are similar to those of Slender Spreadwing (L. rectangularis
) and may be easily confused, but for the larger size, more robust and longer abdomen, and the yellow tarsi and tinted wingtips of Slender Spreadwing. The mid-dorsum of the thorax is generally darker than in Plateau (L. alacer
) and Rainpool (L. forficula
) Spreadwings. The abdomen of Lyre-tipped Spreadwing (L . unguiculatus
) is metallic green.","Still, slow moving waters, including permanent or ephemeral ponds, marshes and lakes with moderate vegetation.","This species has received considerable attention by workers due to both its abundance and taxonomic confusion. This species is found everywhere within the region except the extreme western edge where it is replaced by is northern counterpart, L. disjunctus Selys (Northern Spreadwing). Southern Spreadwing is colored similar to the more northern Sweetflag Spreadwing (L. forcipatus
) and their caudal appendages closely resemble one another. Early records for both of these species must be viewed with caution as a result. Southern Spreadwing emerges early in the south-central United States, mid-March, and flies throughout the rest of the year. This species does, however, seem to be most abundant in the fall. Males are not territorial and individuals are often seen a considerable distance, several hundred meters, from any body of water. Mating activity in this species tends to peak in the late afternoon, ca. 5 P.M. Egg laying occurs in tandem in green stems of cattails and similar plants, above the water line. Females will usually lay over a hundred eggs. The larvae can tolerate considerable salinity and may be a common inhabitant of saline lakes. A population study in eastern Ontario, Canada, on sexual size dimorphism and sex-specific survival in adults, found that there was no difference in the mass of mated and unmated males, but that females were more than 50%
heavier than males. It was also determined that males were eight times more abundant than females; however, females were more active than males.",Throughout all of much of the eastern and southern United States west of the Rocky Mountains.

Its bright red color and erratic movements rarely let it go unnoticed. Males may be seen perched on top of tall grasses and weeds, but when females are present, they are generally seen chasing them in attempts to mate. Unusual among dragonflies, Neon Skimmers exhibit courtship behavior. Males typically only approach females when the are laying eggs. Males approach females with their abdomen raised and clearly visible to females. The female then leaves or the male makes sudden quick advances toward her until she flees, whereupon he attempts to seize her. Males apparently also exhibit threat displays to other males by lowering the abdomen. Copulation typically occurs while perched on limbs or twigs near the water, but it may take place in flight. The entire
process usually does not take longer than 30 seconds. Females then lay eggs guarded by the male only for an initial short time. Oviposition typically occurs at midday, by swiftly flying forward, dipping the abdomen in the water and subsequently throwing eggs with droplets of water on shore. They fly up and back again, repeating this several times.",Southwestern U.S. through Central America south to Colombia.

It is found throughout the New World tropics, including the Bahamas, West Indies and Hawaii. It behaves similarly to many king skimmers (Libellula), foraging from the top of tall vegetation. It is an aggressive predator taking insects only slightly smaller than itself. Males will regularly and vigorously patrol territories averaging 10 m. Males use their abdomens to ward off intruding males by bending the tip downwards. They pursue females in flight, where mating takes place for an avera
ge of 10 sec. Oviposition by females takes an average of 1-3 minutes and is done by flicking the eggs along with water droplets towards the shoreline.

All also have pronounced greenish spots dorsally on abdominal segment 7.","Ponds, lakes, marshes, ditches, slow streams and other quiet bodies of water.","This species is found around nearly any standing body of water where it is often the most common and abundant species. It is known from every county in Arkansas and every parish in Louisiana. As a result it ranks as one of the most well studied dragonflies in North America. The Blue Dasher is often seen perched vertically on twigs and branches at a variety of heights from just above ground level to tree tops with the wings depressed downward. On warmer days individuals will raise the abdomen in an obelisk position, reducing heat absorbance. They are aggressive predators, regularly taking over 10% of their body weight in prey daily. Adults roost in trees and are occasionally attracted to lights at night. This species will def
end favored feeding sites for several days in a row. Breeding territories are established along the shoreline, where males will investigate all intruders, and defend and chase other males out by raising their pruinose blue abdomen. Multiple territories may be established in a single day. Mating takes place while in flight or perched and may last from 1/2 to 2 minutes. The male will guard the female from a nearby perch while she deposits eggs by flying low over the water and repeatedly tapping the abdomen to the surface, but never bobbing the entire body up and down. She may lay 300-700 eggs in only 35 seconds, usually in a heavily vegetated pond margin. Females remain farther back from the water when not laying eggs or mating. The tremendous variation in size within this species is generally correlated with larger individuals during the spring months and progressively smaller ones occurring in the summer and fall. One study found larvae of this species had a strong preference for the l
eaf axil area of the aquatic plants they were associated with. This provides them protection and makes them less susceptible to fish predation.

It is a strong flier, with a circumtropical distribution. It is found in nearly every contiguous state, extreme southern Canada, southward throughout Central and South America, the Bahamas, West Indies, Hawaii and throughout the Eastern Hemisphere, except for Europe. It is a strong flier that is regularly encountered by ocean freighters and a well-known migratory species. Because of its ability to drift with the wind, feeding on aerial plankton, until it finally encounters a rain pool in which it breeds, it has been called ""...the world's most evolved dragonfly."" It is generally more abundant in the fall when offspring from earlier in the spring migrate southward. They are often encountered in large mixed fe
eding swarms, along with saddlebag gliders (Tramea), where they prey upon small flying insects. Males patrol territories of varying lengths 1-2 m above the water. Mating takes place in flight and lasts from 30 sec to an unusually long 5 min. Females lay eggs in temporary ponds or rainpools by tapping their abdomen to the water surface, alone or accompanied by the male. The larva can complete its cycle in as little as five weeks. It is not unusual, however to see females attempting to lay eggs on automobile roof tops, asphalt roads or other shiny structures that they mistake for water. They usually perch vertically on low stems and twigs, but sometimes they will perch horizontally with the abdomen depressed below the rest of the body. Eggs are deposited in ponds while flying in tandem straight over the water. Feeding swarms consist of both males and females in equal numbers over land and can occur at anytime from dawn to dusk. Early instars of the larvae are extremely tolerant to drough

The abdomen is narrowed basally, but thick thereafter and brown with a dark row of chevrons dorsally.",Total length: 19-25 mm; abdomen: 12-16 mm; hindwing: 16-21 mm.,19-25 mm,12-16 mm,16-21 mm.,"Slough Amberwing (P. domitia
) has dark brown stripes, not chevrons, dorsally on the abdomen. Other skimmers with amber in wings are significantly larger.","Open sloughs, ponds, pools, roadside ditches and other still waters.","This small dragonfly has been well studied. It has an elaborate courtship behavior. Males come to the water's edge early in the morning in search of a territory. They then patrol and defend these territories, as potential egg laying sites, where they regularly perch on emergent sticks or twigs. These small territories, less than 5 square m, are only accepted by the male if he is not disturbed and there is no competition from other males. Females appear and are courted by the male. He will fly out to her and lead her back to his prospective oviposition site, hovering with his abdomen turned up. Upon acceptance by the female, signaled by a slower wing beat, the pair perch on a twig and mate, taking 20-30 sec. Females then la
y eggs either accompanied by the male or alone and guarded. Females tap the abdomen against sticks or twigs within the oviposition area, attaching to it a gelatinous mass just above the waterline. The clumps of eggs released into water seem to explode into individual eggs as the clump drifts downward through the water. Both sexes of this group mimic wasps by perching at the ends of grasses or weeds and, while beating their wings, pump the abdomen up and down. Females also fly with the hindwings held together vertically with the abdomen bent up. Females with more darkly pigmented wings tend to select the more favorable oviposition sites such as logs or sticks, and the lighter pigmented females select less favorable patches of floating vegetation. Andromorphic females, with diffusely amber wings, are occasionally reported. One study found that males that were prevented from mating were much more likely to change potential oviposition sites the following day than males that were allowed t
o mate, possibly implying that males use their reproductive success to determine the quality of oviposition sites.","Eastern and Central U.S., southeastern Canada and Mexico."
Sulphur-tipped Clubtail,Odonata,Anisoptera,Gomphioidea,Gomphidae,Phanogomphus,militaris,"This is the most widespread common clubtail (Gomphus
) in the region, although it is conspicuously absent in both Arkansas and Louisiana. It is marked with the most yellow and is the brightest colored of the common clubtail species. The face is yellow with no evidence of dark stripes. Females have a pair of minute spines present on the vertex. The front of the thorax is distinctly more yellow than the darker sides. The brown middorsal thoracic stripe is narrow, but widens slightly toward the collar. The antehumeral stripe is well separated from the humeral stripe and it is free at its upper end. The pale stripe between them is 1/2-2/3 their width at its widest. The humeral stripe narrows at its lower end. The midlateral stripe is thin and always present, but generally interrupted above the spiracle. The third lateral stripe is also thin, but well-developed. The legs have more yellow than other species. The predominately black femora and tibiae both have yellow stripes on their outer surfaces. The black abdomen is conspicuously narrowed
medially. There is a wide, pale yellow middorsal stripe that is nearly continuous on the middle segments. Segments 7-9 are expanded laterally, less so in females, and segments 8-10 are diffusely yellow with brownish-yellow caudal appendages. Dorsal and lateral pale yellow areas on segment 9 are narrowly separated.

Common Whitetail,Odonata,Anisoptera,Libelluloidea,Libellulidae,Plathemis,lydia,"This is a ubiquitous species, commonly seen at almost any standing body of water during the summer. It is moderate-sized and stout with a distinct dimorphism between the sexes. Males have large broad brown or black bands in the outer portion of each wing, while the female's wings are less maculated, with three spots, basally, at the nodus and apically, appearing as a smaller version of Twelve-spotted Skimmer (Libellula pulchella). Its face is yellowish-brown initially, but becomes noticeably darker in both sexes. The top of the head is deep brown. The robust thorax is brown, unmarked in front and has two yellowish lateral stripes giving way to white at their upper ends. The wings in the male are as above with a small white spot below the basal dark area in the hindwing. The legs are brown. The abdomen is broad appearing triangu

It has been collected in every county in Arkansas (Harp pers. comm.). The distinct white abdomen of mature males is used in displays to threaten other males. They elevate the abdomen above the rest of the body and fly towards an intruder. Males patrol moderate-sized habitats of 15-30 m around the shores of ponds, lakes and occasionally streams. They will often venture some distance from their breeding sites and may commonly be seen along roadsides and path margins perching on the ground, logs or low vegetation. Adults mature after an average of two weeks, after which they return to bodies of water to breed. Males are aggressive, often stealing females from other males. Mating is quick, occurring as the pair hovers over the water, usually no
longer than three seconds. Males will often attempt to guard more than one female as they lay some 1,000 eggs, by tapping the tip of the abdomen to the water in regular intervals. Although this species is widespread, its distribution is limited to the north where more than 1,660 degree days of growth (at a threshold of 5.6o0C

Eastern Ringtail (Erpetogomphus designatus
) is similar but the caudal appendages are both brown, not with yellow cerci and a black epiproct as in Common Sanddragon.",Shallow streams and lakes with a sandy bottoms.,"This eastern species was erroneously reported from Presidio County. The record is actually attributed to Gray Sanddragon. Common Sanddragon is the most abundant clubtail species, found as larvae in many sandy-bottomed streams, of east Texas. Adults can be uncommon, taking refuge in wooded areas surrounding the streams they emerge from. It is not a particularly strong flier and is often seen obelisking. Females lay eggs by quickly flying low over the water and tapping their abdomens to the surface and occasionally while hovering over a riffle. This is the only North American clubtail where males guard females while they lay eggs. Males will remove sperm previously deposited by other males from females during mating, the first known instance in the
family. In east Texas at least, one study found that chironomid larvae and mayfly naiads make up the primary diet of the immatures. I have found this species flying along side Gray Sanddragon as far west as southeastern New Mexico.",Eastern U.S. and southern Great Plains.
